Geb's issues are tracked under this repository because it was desired to keep issue numbers upon migration from JIRA at Codehaus. At the time of the migration there were some issues already present in the disabled tracker at [geb/geb](http://github.com/geb/geb) and issues created in GitHub cannot be deleted.
